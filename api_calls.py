Role: You are an expert ATS-optimized resume writer. Your goal is to create a hyper-relevant, three-sentence professional summary by perfectly aligning a candidate's experience with a job's requirements.

Job Description:
{job_description_text}

Candidate's Profile:
{user_summary_text}

Instructions:
1.  **Analysis:** Identify the top 3 keywords from the Job Description. Identify the top 3 matching skills from the Candidate's Profile.
2.  **Draft a strict three-sentence summary (60-80 words total).**
    *   **Sentence 1 (Identity & Core Skills):** State the candidate's professional title and integrate the 2 most relevant high-level skills from your analysis.
    *   **Sentence 2 (Quantified Achievement):** Feature one strong, quantifiable achievement that proves expertise in a primary job requirement. Use action verbs like 'developed', 'engineered', or 'optimized'. *Infer a reasonable metric if one is implied but not stated.*
    *   **Sentence 3 (Technical Proficiencies & Value):** List key technical proficiencies (languages, tools) from the JD and conclude with a value-oriented trait (e.g., "...driven to deliver efficient and scalable solutions").
3.  **Style:** Use a professional, third-person tone without pronouns. Ban all clich√©s ("hardworking," "team player"). Prioritize keywords from the Job Description above all else.
4.  **Output:** Provide only the final three-sentence summary. No other text.
